### TODO

- Smoothing Pool Interactions (done)
- New RPL functionality (such as stakeRPLFor() on the RocketNodeStaking contract)
- The prior version assumed only 1 BalancesUpdated() would be emitted each day which has lead to missing checkpoints.
- Initial methodology for tracking individuals profits has a cumbersome indexing loop that can be optimized.
- Subgraph should be templated so it can be deployed on the other networks that rETH and RPL are on.

### Pull the rETH Staker Information for an individual address:

NOTE: id's should be be all lowercase

```graphql
query StakerOverview {
  staker(id: "0x...") {
    rETHBalance
    totalETHRewards
    ethBalance
    id
  }
}
```

### Pull the daily eth rewards for a staker:

```graphql
query StakerOverview {
  stakerBalanceCheckpoints(where: {stakerId: "0x..."}) {
    rETHBalance
    totalETHRewards
    block
    blockTime
    ethBalance
  }
}
```
